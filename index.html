          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
          <p>This redesign was conducted with the goal to facilitate the adoption and education of exotic pets to people looking to adopt and rescue these troubled animals. The project was conducted in three weeks staring form user reasearch to defining and ideating  and prototyping and testing.


            The Problem: The original website was not conducive to increasing adoptions of reptiles and small animals that have been rescued by the nonprofit.
            
            The Solution: Creating a website that focuses on adoption of animals as well as educating the users about the animals that are mentioned.

                        I helped conduct research to explore the reasons why people are reluctant to adopt reptiles and other small animals. In addition, conducting a competitor analysis with my team helped me determine the opportunities the organization could consider improving on in comparison to other organizations. I found with my team that some people struggle with adopting reptiles as pets due to lack of education both from the adopter to their families, in addition to issues involving finances and lack of physical space in their home. The organization can consider using images of the pets available for adoption and organize data and resources to be easily found by the user.

                        I helped create a proto persona by giving ideas and insights as to who might be interested or need the services from Texas Reptile and Small Animal Rescue. Before ideating our user persona, our group had a proto persona of a teacher in his late forties looking for a way to make science fun for his students. After collecting data from the surveys used in our research, we created a proto persona into a user persona, an 18-23 year old male looking to adopt a pet snake.

                        While conducting research with my team, we noticed that the organization mainly used social media to advertise their pets available for adoption. So I began by imagining how images would be used to draw the user's attention. Some features we decided to add onto the nonprofit website include focusing on adding pictures of the animals that were featured in the organization's Instagram page as well as adding an education tab to allow users to find reptiles and or small animals that are bought up for adoption. Additionally, a feature of adding a zoom/skype with an expert to get more information about adoption, caring procedures, as well as just general questions about the animal breeds.

                        With the testing done, we noticed that the original prototype design we made needed to be more concise when we converted the desktop into mobile. There were multiple changes with the design, and color scheme to attract attention to the user while also not being too distracting from the main path we are focusing on which is adoption

                        I conducted a test seeking to find any feedback to see if users find the flow of the prototype logical and easy to follow. The mobile test had two tasks and the desktop had three. All testers were asked to locate various menu options and their movements and time were being watched. All users successfully completed the tasks, which told us our prototypeâ€™s flow was efficient and logical.
